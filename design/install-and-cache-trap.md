# Install and Cache Trap

The structural gap between editing the coderails repo and running coderails. This is the most operationally dangerous thing to get wrong.

## Three Locations

A coderails plugin lives in three distinct places at runtime (verified — confirmed via `ls`, `grep`, and `diff` between all three):

**1. The repo working copy**
`/Users/harrison/Documents/Github/coderails/`

This is what you edit. Every `Edit` tool call lands here. This is the source of truth for development.

**2. The marketplace registration**
Two files record where the plugin's marketplace is and where it's installed:

- `~/.claude/settings.json` lines 68–74 (verified): `extraKnownMarketplaces.coderails.source.path` points to the repo.
- `~/.claude/plugins/known_marketplaces.json` lines 10–15 (verified): `source.path` and `installLocation` both point to the repo.
- `~/.claude/settings.json` line 66 (verified): `"coderails@coderails": true` — the plugin is enabled.

These registrations tell Claude Code where to find the marketplace and that coderails is installed. They do not tell it what the plugin *contains*. That comes from location 3.

**3. The runtime cache**
`~/.claude/plugins/cache/coderails/coderails/1.0.0/`

This is what the Claude Code harness actually runs. It is a snapshot populated when the plugin was last installed or reinstalled. The directory structure mirrors the repo: `commands/`, `hooks/`, `skills/`, `scripts/`, etc. (verified — `ls` output).

The version `1.0.0` matches `plugin.json` version (verified: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` line 3: `"version": "1.0.0"`).

## The Trap

**Editing the repo does not change what the harness runs.**

When you edit `commands/workflow.md` in the repo, the harness continues to load and execute `~/.claude/plugins/cache/coderails/coderails/1.0.0/commands/workflow.md`. These are separate files. They can drift apart.

The current state (verified — `diff` confirmed): files are identical because the cache was populated recently. But the identity is coincidental, not guaranteed.

## What Syncs the Cache (and What Doesn't)

| Action | Updates cache? |
|---|---|
| Edit a file in the repo | No |
| `/reload-plugins` | No — reloads plugin metadata, does not re-copy files from repo to cache |
| `/plugin install coderails` | Yes — repopulates cache from repo |
| `install.sh` re-run | No — install.sh sets up CLAUDE.md and settings.json but does not touch the plugin cache |

The CLAUDE.md "Working in this repo" section (line 124–126) says `/reload-plugins` is sufficient after editing a command or hook. That claim is about the harness picking up the *already-cached* files freshly — it does not mean the cache is re-populated from the repo. If the cache file and the repo file have diverged, `/reload-plugins` will load the stale cache copy. (inferred from cache structure; the authoritative test is to make a distinct change in the repo and observe what the harness actually executes.)

## Practical Implication

After making a change to any hook, command, or skill:

1. **Check**: is the cache copy identical to the repo copy?
   ```bash
   diff /Users/harrison/Documents/Github/coderails/commands/workflow.md \
        ~/.claude/plugins/cache/coderails/coderails/1.0.0/commands/workflow.md
   ```
2. **If they differ**: run `/plugin install coderails` to repopulate the cache, then `/reload-plugins`.
3. **Verify**: re-run the diff to confirm the cache now matches.

The hooks that enforce the discipline loop live at `hooks/scripts/*.sh` in the repo — but the harness runs the cache copies. A hook fix that never made it into the cache is not a deployed fix.

## Why This Pattern Exists

Claude Code's plugin architecture separates the marketplace source (which can be a local directory or a GitHub repo) from the installed cache. This allows version-pinning, rollback, and offline operation. For a local-directory plugin like coderails, the "version" is always `1.0.0` regardless of how many edits have been made — there is no semantic versioning increment on each save. The cache is only refreshed when the harness is explicitly asked to reinstall.

## Bash 3.2 portability

`install.sh` must run on **bash 3.2** — macOS ships that as `/bin/bash`, and the
`#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang picks up whatever is first on PATH (3.2 on a stock
Mac). No bash-4 syntax: no `${var,,}`/`${var^^}` case modification, no associative
arrays, no `mapfile`. A `${answer,,}` slipped in and broke the overwrite prompt on a
3.2 machine with "bad substitution"; fixed by `tr` lowercase.

## Cross-References

- [[enforcement-model]] — hooks only enforce what the cache contains
- [[discipline-loop]] — if a hook fix is in the repo but not the cache, the discipline enforcement is running the old version
- [[install-bash32-bad-substitution_2026-06-01]] — the bash 3.2 syntax bug and fix
