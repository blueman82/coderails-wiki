# Skill: dashboard

Launches the coderails observability dashboard — a live local web HUD showing sessions, agentic loops, PR gate states, runs, and memory activity — plus a companion Obsidian command centre. Sub-project 1 of a 5-part agentic-OS evolution sequence (observability → routines → workflow-audit → assistant-agent kernel integration → improvement loops); see the design spec's decisions log for the other four.

Source: `coderails/skills/dashboard/SKILL.md`
Design spec: `coderails/docs/coderails/specs/2026-07-06-observability-dashboard-design.md`
Plan: `coderails/docs/coderails/plans/2026-07-06-observability-dashboard-plan.md`
Invoked as: `coderails:dashboard`

## What it shows

Seven panels, all reading state the kernel already produces (no new services, no telemetry leaving the machine): SYSTEM VITALS (usage/hooks/lint sparklines), DIRECTIVES (active loop's `progress.json` work units as a checklist), DOCUMENTS/MEMORY.TRAIL (wiki + memory mtime feed), COMMAND DECK (declared one-click buttons + run history), PR GATES (merge-ready / blocked / stale, from the marker-grammar libs), a bottom-centre hero stat, and ASSISTANT.LINK — originally a reserved placeholder for sub-project 4 (assistant-agent kernel integration), now a real panel (coderails PR #31) rendering the pending send-approval queue for assistant-agent's send-gate; see [[assistant-link-send-gate-architecture]].

## Architecture

One Next.js process serves both the React Three Fiber HUD frontend and the API routes: an SSE stream (`/api/events`) and a token + Origin-guarded run trigger (`/api/run`). Binds `127.0.0.1` only. Collectors read: `~/.claude/projects/*` session dirs, agentic-loop `progress.json` (via the existing `agentic_loop_path.sh` SSOT — see [[agentic-loop]]), `gh`-polled PR state parsed with the same marker grammar as `review-artifact.sh`/`eval-artifact.sh` (see [[review-artifact-seam]] and [[task-evals-gate]]), hook logs, and wiki/memory mtimes.

### Button / run model — the security-load-bearing piece

A button is a declared, bounded run, never a free prompt box. `POST /run` looks up a button name in `~/.claude/coderails-dashboard.json` and refuses anything undeclared. `buildArgv()` in `src/lib/argv.ts` is the **single** profile→flag mapping (`read-only` → `--allowedTools Read Grep Glob`; `standard` → inherit target project's allowlists; `auto` → `--permission-mode auto`, added [[pr_128_dashboard-ask-button-auto-profile|PR #128]]; `bypass` → `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, opt-in per button, warning badge in both UIs) — the Obsidian plugin must reuse it, never re-implement it.

**`auto` closes a headless-only hang, not tool-call non-determinism ([[pr_128_dashboard-ask-button-auto-profile|PR #128]], 2026-07-10).** In headless `claude -p` mode, `standard` adds no permission flags, so a tool needing a fresh permission grant (e.g. `WebSearch`) blocks indefinitely on an unanswerable prompt — the model then silently falls back to answering from memory with no tool call ever attempted. `--permission-mode auto` auto-approves the permission decision instead of blocking on it, closing that specific hang. It does **not** fix the separate, already-documented non-determinism of *whether the model attempts the tool call at all*: direct empirical testing (both in the PR's own `argv.ts:40-49` code comment and independently reproduced this session) found only 1 real tool call in 3 consecutive identical runs, the other 2 falling back to "I don't have internet access" with no attempt and no permission-block message. See [[pr_128_dashboard-ask-button-auto-profile]] for the full finding.

**Flag-smuggling closed by two independent layers**, found and fixed during review (Tier-2 eval / review cycle, not caught by the original implementation): a leading-dash input like `--dangerously-skip-permissions` would otherwise be parsed by the `claude` CLI as a real flag rather than literal prompt text (confirmed empirically: `claude -p "--version"` prints the version banner instead of answering the prompt). The fix: (1) `input` starting with `-` (checked against the **trimmed** value, so whitespace can't hide a leading dash from this check — closed 2026-07-07, PR #70) is rejected outright before any sentinel is trusted, and (2) a literal `--` end-of-options sentinel is always inserted before the prompt regardless, confirmed on-machine to make the CLI treat everything after it as literal text. Neither layer alone was judged sufficient — the review explicitly wanted the reject-outright check as a second wall, not just the sentinel.

**Input-delivery bug, found and fixed 2026-07-07 (PR #70 — see [[pr_70-71_2026-07-07_dashboard-input-fix-and-voice-announcements]]):** the original argv shape pushed `input` as **a separate positional argv element** after `btn.command` and the sentinel (`["-p", btn.command, ...profileFlags, "--", input]`). The `claude` CLI's `-p`/`--print` only consumes ONE positional prompt — it never merges a second positional into the prompt already consumed, so `input` silently never reached the model on **any** `inputAllowed` button, since the button model's inception (`verify-q`, `deep-research`). Caught by an intake smoke test observing the *live* dashboard's response, not by any argv-shape unit test — every prior test checked shape only, none checked that input was actually delivered, so the pre-fix code passed all of them. Fixed by merging `command` and `input` into **one** prompt string before the sentinel: `btn.command ? \`${btn.command} ${input}\` : input`, giving the current shape `["-p", ...profileFlags, "--", mergedPrompt]` when input is present (profile flags precede the sentinel; the merged prompt is the sole positional after it). Without input, the original single-token shape is unchanged. Empty/whitespace-only input is now normalised to "no input" inside `buildArgv` itself (not just at the UI layer), and `buildArgv` throws on an empty effective prompt (no command and no input) — `route.ts`'s existing catch surfaces this as a 400.

A new **"ask" button pattern** follows directly from this fix: `command: ""`, `profile: "standard"`, `inputAllowed: true` — free text becomes the entire prompt inside the button's declared envelope (profile flags still apply). Live in the owner's per-user config; documented in `examples/dashboard-config.json` (4th button, first time exercised by `lib/test/config.test.ts`).

Every run is single-flight per button, JSONL-recorded (`~/.claude/coderails-dashboard/runs/`) with argv/cwd/profile/exit code, and CSRF-token-guarded (both `/api/events` and `/api/run` also reject non-localhost `Origin`/`Host`).

### Run Output viewer — live-streaming + settled playback (PR #80–82)

The COMMAND DECK's 4th panel, `OutputViewerPanel.tsx`, closes a gap
[[dashboard-run-log-streaming-viewer-gap_2026-07-07]] documented the same day: the per-run
`.log` file used to be write-only (one post-exit `appendFileSync`), never read anywhere. As of
[[pr_80-82_dashboard-stream-run-output-viewer]], `POST /api/run` spawns `claude` with
`--output-format stream-json --include-partial-messages --verbose` and streams each
stdout/stderr chunk incrementally: appended to `runs/<runId>.log` as it arrives, and published
on a new in-process pub/sub (`lib/runOutputBus.ts`) that the `/api/events` aggregator forwards
as a `"run-output"` SSE event (`{runId, chunk}`) — deliberately riding the **existing** single
SSE connection rather than opening a second one, per the single-SSE-provider rule established
in PR #25's own fix-loop. A new non-throwing, forward-compatible parser (`lib/streamJson.ts`)
validates each line is at least well-formed-or-gracefully-skipped without maintaining an
event-type allowlist; parse failures never affect what's appended/published.

The panel live-streams a still-active run from the accumulated `DashboardState.runOutput` map;
once a run ends, it fetches the full settled output once from a new `GET /api/run/output` route,
which resolves `runId` (format-validated `/^[0-9a-f]{16}$/`) to its `RunRecord` in `runs.jsonl`
and reads *that record's own* `outputPath` — `runId` is never itself joined into a filesystem
path, going one step further than the strict-format-validation precedent
([[pr_31_assistant-link-approve-button]]) that motivated the check in the first place. Two
Criticals were found and fixed in review: a missing `child.on("error", ...)` handler (a spawn
failure like `ENOENT` would otherwise hang the request forever and leak the per-button lock),
and a `fetchSettledOutput` that silently swallowed all fetch/parse errors (now a discriminated
result type with a distinct in-progress/error/ok case and a visible retry button).

**Settled output is parsed, not dumped raw ([[pr_124_dashboard-run-output-result-extraction]],
2026-07-09).** PR #80–82 shipped `lib/streamJson.ts`'s parser but nothing consumed its parsed
`{ok, value}` shape beyond the never-throws guarantee — `GET /api/run/output` returned the
entire raw JSONL log file as `output`, so the panel rendered every hook/system/assistant event
verbatim with the actual answer buried in a nested blob at the end (surfaced by a real user
report: a correct "what time is it in Dublin" answer was unfindable on screen). Fixed with a
module-private `extractResultText()` in `route.ts` that scans the log backwards for the last
`type:"result"` line and returns its `result` field, falling back to the raw content if no valid
result line exists (crashed run, or a non-string `result` e.g. an `error_during_execution`
subtype) — same fallback value as the old behavior, so that path is unchanged by construction.

### AssistantLinkPanel — per-producer readable rendering

`AssistantLinkPanel.tsx` (PR #31 — full build-out in
[[pr_31_assistant-link-approve-button]]) renders the queue directory's
pending entries via the same collector/Approve-Deny path regardless of
producer, treating `toolInput` opaquely by default (`JSON.stringify` +
truncate). As of [[pr_43-44-46_workflow-audit-queue-seam]] (PR #44), a
type-guarded render branch recognises `toolName ===
"workflow-audit:propose-skill"` (the [[workflow-audit]] skill's queue-mode
output) and displays it readably — proposed name / description / task
summary / session count — instead of the opaque fallback, which still covers
every other `toolName` (e.g. send-gate entries, per
[[assistant-link-send-gate-architecture]]). The Approve/Deny buttons and
`POST /api/queue` path are unchanged by this branch; only the preview differs
per producer.

**Build-state visibility (added by [[pr_55-60-64-66-67_approve-build-runner]],
PR #66):** a new `collectBuilds` collector reads `~/.claude/coderails-dashboard/builds/<hash>/state.json`
sidecars (closed-set `state` validation mirroring `queue.ts`'s discipline —
reject unknown/missing, never default), exposed as `Snapshot.builds`. The
panel hash-joins each approved queue entry to its build sidecar and renders
one of building / awaiting-your-merge / failed / builder-dead (on a stale
heartbeat). Includes a real XSS fix: `prUrl` is builder-session-controlled
data (read verbatim from `run-builder.sh`'s own `gh pr create` output, not
dashboard-generated), so a `safePrUrl()` guard only links `https:`-protocol
URLs — a `javascript:`/`data:` scheme would otherwise be a click-triggered
vector — falling back to a plain-text CTA otherwise.

**Honest build feedback (added by [[pr_89-100-104-106_approve-build-e5-live]],
PR #106):** the bare `building` (opaque for up to 45 minutes) is replaced with
live progress. The builder writes a coarse phase — one of `authoring | testing
| pushing | opening_pr` — to `builds/<hash>/phase`; `collectBuilds`
closed-set-validates that word **before it reaches the client** (same
reject-never-default discipline as `state`), and the panel shows `building`
followed by the phase, an elapsed timer (from `startedAt`), and heartbeat
freshness ("last active Ns ago"). After a build's PR leaves the dashboard's
open-PR set (merged or closed) the panel shows **`PR resolved`** instead of a
stale `awaiting your merge` — the builder now writes `pr_url` immediately after
`gh pr create` so the join can happen. A **null-guard skips reconciliation**
(falls back to `awaiting`) whenever the open-PR set is untrustworthy — gates
not loaded, poll failed, or a repo degraded to an error entry — so an open PR
is never falsely marked resolved. `buildPrompt` gained a `buildDir` parameter
to interpolate the concrete phase-file path.

### Obsidian command centre

A native Obsidian plugin (official TypeScript template) registering a code-block processor (`agentic-os`) that renders dashboard state inside a real markdown note, sharing the same button config as the web deck. The routines sub-project (#2, now shipped — see [[intent-queue-runner-contract]] and [[dashboard-runner]]) defines the queue+runner contract this seam was frozen against; the plugin writes intent files to `~/.claude/coderails-dashboard/queue/` per that contract, but still also keeps its interim direct-exec path — [[dashboard-runner]] existing doesn't yet make the plugin stop invoking `claude` itself, so the plugin has not yet been updated to rely solely on the now-real runner. Ships a committed, reproducible `dist/main.js` build (same precedent as `wiki-init`'s committed Marp assets).

**`pressButton` buildArgv error-handling parity ([[pr_86-107_2026-07-08_loop-lib-residuals|PR #86]], 2026-07-08):** the interim direct-exec path's `pressButton` function (`src/exec.ts`) now wraps its `buildArgv(button, input)` call in a `try`/`catch`, returning `{ ok: false, reason: "invalid-input" }` on throw instead of letting the exception propagate uncaught — matching the web app's `route.ts`, which already had this catch. `buildArgv` throws on an empty effective prompt (no command and no input) or a leading-whitespace-then-dash flag-smuggling shape; pre-#86, either input crashed the Obsidian plugin's press instead of resolving to a `PressResult`.

## Starting / stopping

`skills/dashboard/scripts/start-dashboard.sh` (npm ci → build → start → open, idempotent re-launch) and `stop-dashboard.sh` (kills the pidfile'd process). Port overridable via `DASHBOARD_PORT`.

**First-run gotcha:** `npm ci` is exact-lock — unlike `npm install`, it fails hard (`EUSAGE`) rather than silently repairing if `package-lock.json` has drifted from `package.json`, including drift in optional/transitive native deps (e.g. `@emnapi/*`). See [[dashboard-lockfile-emnapi-drift_2026-07-08]] for a case that blocked first run this way and the general fix (`npm install --package-lock-only`).

### Surviving reboots (launchd)

[[pr_88_93_dashboard-launchd]] gives the dashboard the same reboot-survival mechanism [[routines]] already has: a launchd LaunchAgent (`launchd/com.coderails.dashboard.plist`, `RunAtLoad`+`KeepAlive`+`ThrottleInterval 60`) instead of the manually-started, pidfile-tracked process above. A thin exec wrapper, `skills/dashboard/runner/bin/dashboard-server.sh`, execs `npm run start` in the foreground (sibling to `install-routines.sh`'s `bin/*.sh` pattern — a background+PID-file model here would just leave launchd babysitting an empty shell). It deliberately duplicates ~13 lines of `start-dashboard.sh`'s build-if-stale logic rather than sharing it (accepted YAGNI; unify only if the copies drift), extended with a fail-safe check the manual script doesn't need: staleness also compares `package.json`/`package-lock.json`/`next.config.mjs` against `.next`, not just `src/`, since a daemon has no operator to notice a stale build.

`launchd/install-dashboard-agent.sh` / `uninstall-dashboard-agent.sh` copy the plist into `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` and bootstrap from that copy — the same load-bearing fix [[routines]]' own boot-persistence section documents discovering first (a bootstrap from the repo path silently unloads on reboot; launchd only auto-loads plists living in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`). The installer also refuses to bootstrap if port 4173 is already held (`lsof` pre-flight), avoiding an EADDRINUSE crash-loop against a live manual server.

**Once the agent is installed, `stop-dashboard.sh` cannot stop it** (no pidfile for the agent-owned process) — use `launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.coderails.dashboard`. Stop any manual server first; installing the agent while a manual server holds the port causes a `ThrottleInterval`-rate-limited (60s) crash-loop until one side stops.

**Uninstall race, fixed same day ([[pr_88_93_dashboard-launchd]], PR #93):** `launchctl bootout` is asynchronous for a running `KeepAlive` job (~2s observed to actually unload) — a single immediate `launchctl print` re-check spuriously reported "still loaded" and bailed before removing the LaunchAgents copy. The uninstaller now polls up to 10×1s before declaring failure, and only removes the copy after the loaded-check passes.

## Process record (this PR)

16 SDD tasks, each with an independent review. Five fix loops closed real findings: a lock TOCTOU (Critical), marker grammar drift, `hooksFired` today-scoping, a single-SSE-provider requirement, and the flag-smuggling vector above (High). The frozen Tier-2 eval suite (10 evals, required because this PR is both ≥3 work-units and touches an outward/irreversible surface — see [[task-evals]]'s tier rules) caught **two production bugs every review round missed**: the launch script reported false-success against a squatted port, and a statically-prerendered page baked an empty button config into the HTML (fixed by forcing the route dynamic). Both eval and review artifacts were posted SHA-bound on the PR and consumed by the merge gates ([[task-evals-gate]], [[review-artifact-seam]]).

## Why this matters beyond the feature

This is the first sub-project to give the task-evals gate a real production catch it can point to — prior task-evals coverage was about the gate's own mechanics (oracle independence, tier justification), not a demonstrated bug caught in the wild. See [[task-evals]] and [[task-evals-gate]] for the mechanism this exercised.
